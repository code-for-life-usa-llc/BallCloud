    <p class="card-text">A big, long and talented lefty who has all the physical tools to be an elite PF/C at the NBA level. 
Wiseman is developing rapidly and could blossom into a one and done top 5 pick.Wiseman has a great frame with long arms, good strength and excellent agility. He runs the floor well and is a high level athlete, not just a big body. He can play in areas above the rim that most players can't reach.

His post up and mid range game are on point and he knows how to get to his spot and body up against the defender to create space. He shows quick moves in the lane and a soft touch around the basket. He's a ferocious dunker who can really explode off the floor and play way above the rim. He's also got a sweet left-hand baby hook shot, which he shoots with great elevation.

He has a nice shooting stroke and shows a lot of promise as a mid range scorer, with potential to expand his range out to three. He's a true post player but is also highly skilled from the perimeter. He's a skilled passer in half court sets and also a great outlet passer after defensive rebounds.

Wiseman is a force on the defensive end, where he alters and blocks a lot of shots, showing good timing, quick elevation and good shot blocking instincts. His awareness on the defensive end is something that can't be taught and Wiseman projects as a legit rim protector at the college and NBA levels. He also does a nice job of altering perimeter shots and has enough foot-speed to bother guards beyond the three point line.

He has size, length and instincts that you can't teach and a chance to be special.   </p>

    <p class="card-text">A compact and strong lead guard from great bloodlines. The son of Greg Anthony, Cole is one of the top PG prospects in his class, thanks to his high level athleticism and advanced understanding of the game. Anthony has a super smooth game; whether it's creating space for his shot, creating for teammates or scoring in the lane he makes the game look easy, like he's playing one step ahead of everyone else on the court. He's got all of the intangibles you want in a point guard including super high BBIQ, leadership qualities, play-making ability and toughness.

He's also a surprisingly bouncy athlete who can put defenders on a poster. He's a great ball handler who can drive and finish with either hand. His quickness with the dribble allows him to get into the lane and draw a second defender and he's a slick passer who knows when to deliver the ball. He excels at operating in half court sets and he's also a threat in transition, showing great vision and pass-ahead ability.

Anthony is a committed and tough defender who drops into his stance and gets after the ball handler. He's got extremely quick feet and great overall quickness to stay in front of his man.

He's a solid rebounder for a guard thanks to his leaping ability, good strength and great feel for the game/timing.
